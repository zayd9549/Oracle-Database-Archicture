## ‚úÖ **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**

üìò **Definition**:
An **RDBMS** is a type of **Database Management System** that organizes data into **tables** using the **relational model** proposed by **E.F. Codd** in 1970. It allows for **efficient storage**, **retrieval**, and **management** of structured data through relationships among tables.

### üß© **1. Core Components**

| Component   | Description                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tables**  | Main storage objects. Each table holds rows (records) and columns (fields).    |
| **Rows**    | Represent individual records (also known as tuples).                           |
| **Columns** | Represent attributes or fields of the records.                                 |
| **Schema**  | Logical grouping of related database objects like tables, views, indexes, etc. |

---

### üîë **2. Keys and Relationships**

| Key Type             | Purpose                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Key (PK)** | Uniquely identifies each record in a table. Cannot be NULL.                   |
| **Foreign Key (FK)** | Creates a **link** between two tables by referencing a PK from another table. |
| **Unique Key**       | Ensures no duplicate values in a column, but can allow NULLs.                 |
| **Composite Key**    | A key formed by combining two or more columns.                                |

üß† **Relationships**:

* **One-to-One**: One record in Table A relates to one in Table B.
* **One-to-Many**: One record in Table A maps to many in Table B.
* **Many-to-Many**: Resolved through **junction tables**.

---

### üìê **3. Data Modeling & Normalization**

* **Normalization** is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.

| Normal Form | Description                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Eliminates repeating groups (atomic values only).                                        |
| 2NF         | Removes partial dependencies (related to composite PKs).                                 |
| 3NF         | Removes transitive dependencies (non-PK fields shouldn't depend on other non-PK fields). |

### üí° **4. Key Features of RDBMS**

| Feature               | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Integrity**    | Enforced using constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, CHECK).  |
| **Data Consistency**  | Maintained via ACID-compliant transactions.            |
| **Security**          | Controlled via user roles, privileges, auditing.       |
| **Multi-user Access** | Concurrent access with isolation to prevent conflicts. |
| **Backup & Recovery** | Protects data using physical and logical backups.      |
| **SQL Support**       | Standard query language used across all RDBMS.         |
| **Scalability**       | Supports large-scale data and high user concurrency.   |

---

### üîÑ **5. ACID Properties of Transactions**

Oracle ensures transaction integrity using these **ACID** principles:

| Property        | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atomicity**   | Entire transaction is treated as a single unit ‚Äì all or nothing.               |
| **Consistency** | Transitions database from one valid state to another.                          |
| **Isolation**   | Transactions execute independently (ensuring no dirty reads or phantom reads). |
| **Durability**  | Committed changes survive crashes or failures.                                 |

## **2. Database Terminology and Concepts**

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Schema vs. Database**

| Term         | Definition                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database** | A **container** that holds all data and metadata for a system. Includes objects like schemas, users, tables, indexes, and configuration. |
| **Schema**   | A **logical collection of database objects** (tables, views, procedures) that belong to a single user or application.                    |

#### üîπ Example:

In Oracle:

* You create a user: `CREATE USER HR;`
* That user owns a schema: `HR` schema (contains tables like `EMPLOYEES`, `DEPARTMENTS`).

#### üß† Analogy:

* **Database** is like a library.
* **Schemas** are sections in that library (History, Science, Fiction), each with their own collection of books.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Database Instance vs. Database**

| Term         | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance** | The set of **memory structures (SGA) and background processes** used to access database files. |
| **Database** | The **physical storage**: datafiles, control files, redo logs on disk.                         |

#### üîπ Key Insight:

* A **database** can be mounted and opened by one or more **instances** (e.g., in RAC ‚Äì Real Application Clusters).
* An **instance** cannot function without a database.

#### üß† Analogy:

* Think of **Database** as the data stored on a hard drive.
* **Instance** is the engine (memory + processes) that reads/writes to it.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Client-Server Architecture**

This model explains how **applications (clients)** interact with the **database system (server)**.

#### üîπ Components:

* **Client**: Sends SQL queries, UI interaction (SQL Developer, Java App, etc.)
* **Server**: Processes those queries using the DB engine and sends results.

#### üîπ Types:

* **Two-tier**: Client ‚Üî Database directly
* **Three-tier**: Client ‚Üî Application Server ‚Üî Database (common in web apps)

#### üß† Analogy:

* You (client) place an order.
* Waiter (app server) takes it to the kitchen (DB server).
* Kitchen prepares food (data) and sends it back through the waiter.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Logical Data Storage Units**

Databases store data in a **structured hierarchy** of logical units. These include **Blocks, Extents, and Segments**. These aren't tied to any one RDBMS ‚Äî the concepts are universal, though the names or limits may differ.

#### üî∏ **1. Data Block**

* Smallest unit of data storage.
* Contains actual row data.
* Size: 2KB to 32KB (Oracle default: 8KB).
* Block has header, row directory, free space, and data rows.

#### üî∏ **2. Extent**

* A group of contiguous blocks.
* Allocated together to improve space management and performance.
* A table grows by getting more extents.

#### üî∏ **3. Segment**

* A collection of extents.
* Represents complete storage for a **logical object** (e.g., a table or index).
* Types: Table segment, Index segment, Undo segment, etc.

#### üîπ **Hierarchy**

```
Segment ‚Üí Extents ‚Üí Blocks ‚Üí Rows
```

#### üîπ **Diagram**

```
Segment (Table 'EMP')
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extent 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Block 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Block 2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extent 2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Extent N
```

#### üß† Analogy:

| Level   | Real-World Equivalent              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Block   | Page in a notebook                 |
| Extent  | Bundle of pages                    |
| Segment | Entire chapter (many page bundles) |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Schema**              | Logical grouping of DB objects             | Section in a library       |
| **Database**            | All physical + logical data and metadata   | Entire library             |
| **Instance**            | Set of processes + memory to access DB     | Engine running the library |
| **Client-Server Model** | Separation of requester vs. data processor | Restaurant ordering system |
| **Block**               | Smallest storage unit, holds rows          | A notebook page            |
| **Extent**              | Group of blocks for object allocation      | A set of pages             |
| **Segment**             | All storage allocated to a DB object       | A full chapter             |

* Use **ORAPWD** tool to manage changes
* Periodically review users with high privileges
---

## ‚úÖ **8. Alert Log**

üìò **Definition**:
*The alert log is a special diagnostic log file that records critical database events and messages. It is the first place DBAs check for errors, startup/shutdown info, and background process messages.*

üìä **Purpose / Usage**:

* Track **startup**, **shutdown**, **log switches**, **errors**, and **recovery actions**
* Record **ORA- errors**, block corruption, and background process alerts
* Critical for **troubleshooting**, **tuning**, and **auditing**

üõ†Ô∏è **Generated By**: Oracle background processes (e.g., PMON, SMON, LGWR)

‚öôÔ∏è **Characteristics**:

* Plain text file, **continuously appended**
* Located under `alert_<SID>.log`
* Found in:

  * Non-ADR: `$ORACLE_BASE/admin/<db_name>/bdump`
  * ADR-enabled: `$ORACLE_BASE/diag/rdbms/<db_name>/<SID>/trace/`

WHERE name = 'Diag Trace';
```

üß† **Best Practice**:

* Use `ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE;` to generate specific session traces

* Use **TKPROF** to interpret trace file content:

  ```bash
  tkprof ora_12345.trc output.txt sys=no
  ```

* Regularly **purge old trace files** to save space

* Automate collection during errors via **ADRCI incidents**

## üß† **LOGICAL STRUCTURE**

**(Under "Instance")**
These are **memory structures and processes** that exist only **while the instance is running**.

üìò **Definition**:
*Logical structures in Oracle represent how data is organized and managed in memory and storage, independent of the physical layout.*


## üîπ **Memory Components**

---

## ‚úÖ **1. System Global Area (SGA)**

üìò **Definition**:
*The System Global Area (SGA) is a shared memory region that contains data and control information for one Oracle database instance. It is used by all server and background processes.*

üìä **Purpose / Usage**:

## ‚úÖ **Oracle Background Processes**

---

### üîπ **1. DBWR (Database Writer)**

üß† **Primary Role**:

* Writes **dirty buffers** (modified data blocks) from the **Database Buffer Cache** to **datafiles**.
* Frees up **buffer cache space** for incoming data blocks.

üõ†Ô∏è **Why Critical?**

* Ensures **durability** by moving data from volatile memory to persistent disk.
* Works with **free buffer management**‚Äîif no clean buffer is available, it must flush dirty blocks to make space.

üìå **Triggers**:

* When the buffer cache has too many dirty blocks.
* On **checkpoint**, **tablespace offline**, or **database shutdown**.

üìé **Key Views**: `V$DBFILE`, `V$BUFFER_POOL_STATISTICS`, `V$SYSSTAT`

Great request! Let's expand the **DBWR (Database Writer)** section by adding **buffer types**, **LRU (Least Recently Used) mechanism**, and related **internal memory management logic** ‚Äî all of which are crucial for a deep understanding of how Oracle handles memory and disk I/O.

---

## üîπ **1. DBWR (Database Writer)**

üß† **Primary Role**:

* Writes **dirty buffers** (modified blocks) from the **Database Buffer Cache** (part of SGA) to **datafiles** on disk.
* Frees up buffer cache space by writing old or infrequently used blocks to disk.

---

### ‚úÖ **Types of Buffers in Buffer Cache**

The **Database Buffer Cache** contains **three main types of buffers**:

| Buffer Type        | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free Buffers**   | Unused buffers ready to be filled with data read from disk.                 |
| **Pinned Buffers** | Buffers currently being accessed by a user session (locked for processing). |
| **Dirty Buffers**  | Buffers that have been modified in memory but **not yet written** to disk.  |

üßæ DBWR is responsible for **flushing dirty buffers** to datafiles and converting them into **free buffers**.

---

### üß† **What is the LRU (Least Recently Used) List?**

Oracle uses an **LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement algorithm** to manage buffer cache memory efficiently.

#### üîÑ **How LRU Works**:

* **Most recently accessed blocks** are kept near the **head** of the list.
* **Least recently used** blocks go to the **tail**.
* When the buffer cache is full and a new block is needed, Oracle looks at the **tail** for a **clean (non-dirty)** buffer to reuse.

#### üìå **But what if buffers at the tail are dirty?**

* Oracle initiates **DBWR** to flush dirty blocks to disk, turning them into **free buffers**.

#### üí° Internally:

* Oracle actually uses **two sub-lists**:

  * **LRU - Writing Sublist**: Buffers eligible for reuse (includes clean and dirty).
  * **LRU - Touch Sublist**: Recently accessed buffers promoted to avoid being aged out.

---

### üîÑ **DBWR's Triggers (When It Wakes Up)**

| Trigger Event                               | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buffer cache has too many dirty buffers** | To prevent shortage of free buffers               |
| **Free buffer shortage**                    | Reclaims space by writing dirty buffers to disk   |
| **Checkpoint**                              | Flushes all dirty buffers to disk for consistency |
| **Tablespace/datafile offline/drop**        | Writes related buffers to disk                    |
| **Database shutdown**                       | Ensures all data is persistent                    |

---

### üß∞ **Performance Considerations**

* **Too many dirty buffers** ‚Üí Increased pressure on DBWR.
* **Frequent writes** ‚Üí Higher I/O, but better consistency during recovery.
* **Buffer busy waits** ‚Üí Happens when no free/pinned buffer is available (DBWR lagging behind).

---

### üìé **Relevant Views for Monitoring**:

* `V$DB_CACHE_ADVICE` ‚Äì Buffer cache tuning suggestions
* `V$BUFFER_POOL_STATISTICS` ‚Äì Hit ratios, dirty buffer stats
* `V$SYSSTAT` ‚Äì Overall buffer activity (`db block gets`, `consistent gets`)
* `V$WAITSTAT`, `V$SESSION_WAIT` ‚Äì Identify waits like `buffer busy waits`

---

## üîπ **2. LGWR (Log Writer)**

üß† **Primary Role**:

* Writes **redo entries** from the **Redo Log Buffer** (in SGA) to the **online redo log files** on disk.
* Ensures **durability** of committed transactions (crash recovery guarantee).
* Maintains the **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** principle ‚Äî especially **Durability**.

---

### üß± **Redo Log Buffer ‚Äì What LGWR Writes**

* The **Redo Log Buffer** temporarily stores *change vectors* ‚Äî small pieces of information that describe **data changes** (not the data itself).
* These include DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), DDL, and internal metadata changes.
* LGWR writes these changes to **online redo log files**.

---

### ‚è∞ **When Does LGWR Write? (Trigger Events)**

| Trigger Event                      | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **COMMIT / ROLLBACK issued**       | LGWR writes all redo for the committed transaction to redo logs before acknowledging success to user. |
| **Redo Log Buffer one-third full** | Writes automatically to avoid buffer overflow.                                                        |
| **Every 3 seconds (timeout)**      | Default behavior to flush redo if no activity.                                                        |
| **DBWR writes dirty buffers**      | LGWR writes redo first to maintain Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) protocol.                                |
| **Log Switch**                     | LGWR finishes writing to current log and starts the next redo log group.                              |

---

### üîÑ **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Principle**

Before **DBWR** can write dirty data blocks to disk, **LGWR must first** flush **redo entries** describing those changes.
This ensures that during crash recovery, Oracle can **reconstruct the changes** using redo logs.

---

### üß∞ **LGWR & Crash Recovery**

* Redo logs written by LGWR are **essential for instance/crash recovery**.
* Upon restart after a crash, **SMON** applies redo from the online redo logs to **bring the DB to a consistent state**.
* Without redo, Oracle can't recover committed transactions.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Log Groups and Members**

* LGWR writes to **one redo log group at a time**.
* Each group can have **multiple members (multiplexing)** for redundancy.
* In case one member fails, LGWR continues writing to others in the same group.

---

### üîç **Performance & Wait Events**

| Issue                      | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `log file sync` wait       | Happens when sessions wait for LGWR to flush redo (commit latency).            |
| `log file parallel write`  | LGWR waiting for I/O to complete writing redo logs.                            |
| **Frequent commits**       | Can overload LGWR, increasing commit latency.                                  |
| **Slow I/O for redo logs** | Directly impacts overall DB performance. Use fast disks or SSDs for redo logs. |

* `V$SESSION_WAIT` ‚Äì Look for `log file sync` or `log file parallel write`

---

### üí° Best Practices

* Use **multiple redo log members** per group (multiplexing).
* Place redo logs on **fast storage** (preferably SSD or separate disk).
* Avoid **too frequent commits** in application logic.

---

## üîπ **3. SMON (System Monitor)**

üß† **Primary Role**:
SMON is responsible for **instance recovery**, **temporary space cleanup**, and **space management** tasks.
It ensures that the database starts in a consistent state after an **abnormal shutdown or crash**.

---

### üîÅ **SMON's Core Responsibilities**

| Function                      | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crash Recovery**            | Applies committed changes from redo logs and rolls back uncommitted ones using the **redo and undo**. |
| **Temporary Segment Cleanup** | Frees space used by **temporary segments** that were not deallocated (e.g., failed sort operations).  |
| **Coalescing Free Space**     | Merges adjacent free extents in **dictionary-managed tablespaces** to reduce fragmentation.           |
| **Shrinking Undo Segments**   | Reclaims undo space no longer in use.                                                                 |
| **Instance/Startup Recovery** | Automatically runs if Oracle detects a crash upon startup.                                            |

---

### ü©∫ **Crash Recovery (Instance Recovery)**

When Oracle detects that the **last shutdown was not clean** (e.g., power failure, kill -9, crash), SMON initiates **instance recovery**, consisting of two main steps:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Redo (Roll Forward)

* Reads **online redo logs**.
* **Re-applies committed changes** that were not yet written to datafiles.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Undo (Roll Back)

* Uses undo information to **rollback**:

  * Incomplete/uncommitted transactions.
  * Transactions from users who were mid-operation during crash.

üìå **SMON uses:**

* Redo log files (written by LGWR)
* Undo segments (managed via undo tablespace)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **SMON & Temporary Segments**

* Temporary segments can be created during operations like:

  * `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `SORT`, `CREATE INDEX`, etc.
* If a session ends unexpectedly, SMON removes these **orphaned temp segments** automatically.

---

### üìè **SMON & Free Space Coalescing**

* In **dictionary-managed tablespaces**, SMON:

  * Periodically merges adjacent free extents.
  * Helps reduce **space fragmentation**.
* In **locally managed tablespaces (LMTs)**, this is no longer needed (bitmap-based management).

---

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Monitoring SMON Activity**

| View         | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `V$SESSION`  | SMON will show up as a background process with `PROGRAM='SMON'`.            |
| `V$PROCESS`  | Tracks the OS process linked to SMON.                                       |
| `V$UNDOSTAT` | Undo segment usage info (relevant during recovery).                         |
| `ALERT.LOG`  | Will log crash recovery steps (roll forward, roll back, recovery duration). |

---

### üõë **What Happens During a Crash? (Simplified Flow)**

1. Crash happens (e.g., power outage).
2. Upon next startup:

   * Oracle checks **SCN in control file vs datafiles**.
   * Detects mismatch ‚Üí triggers SMON.
3. SMON:

   * Applies redo (from logs) to redo committed changes.
   * Rolls back any uncommitted transactions.
4. Database opens **clean and consistent**.

---

### üîê **SMON is Critical**

* Without SMON, Oracle **cannot perform instance recovery**.
* It is started automatically and **must always be running** in any healthy Oracle instance.

---

### üí° Best Practices & Notes

* You don‚Äôt manually control SMON‚Äîit is automatic and essential.
* If you observe **long startup times after a crash**, check:

  * Size of redo logs.
  * Number of uncommitted transactions.
  * Disk I/O performance (affects redo read & undo application).
* Always check `alert.log` after instance recovery for details.

---

## üîπ **4. PMON (Process Monitor)**

üß† **Primary Role**:
PMON is responsible for **detecting failed user and server processes**, **cleaning up resources** they held, and **restoring availability** of those resources to the system.

---

### üßπ **PMON's Core Responsibilities**

| Function                       | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process Cleanup**            | Cleans up after user or background process failure (e.g., kills, crashes).              |
| **Session Resource Release**   | Frees up memory, rollback segments, locks, cursors, and temp segments.                  |
| **Listener Registration**      | Registers instance information with the Oracle Listener (Dynamic Service Registration). |
| **Restart Failed Dispatchers** | In shared server mode, restarts failed dispatchers and servers.                         |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **When Does PMON Get Triggered?**

PMON is **event-driven**, not time-based:

* Triggered **only** when a **process failure or crash** is detected.
* Common causes:

  * `kill -9` on a client session.
  * Network disconnection.
  * Application crashes without proper logoff.

---

### üîÑ **Steps Performed by PMON on Session Crash**

Let‚Äôs say a user‚Äôs session suddenly terminates mid-transaction. PMON will:

1. **Detect** the abnormal process termination.
2. **Free PGA memory** allocated to that user session.
3. **Release locks** (DML/DDL) held by the session.
4. **Mark any active transactions** for rollback by SMON.
5. **Deallocate temp segments** used by the session.
6. **Close cursors** or connections left open.
7. **Restore session slots** for reuse.

---

### üì° **PMON & Listener Communication**

PMON performs **Dynamic Registration** with the Oracle **Listener**, especially important when:

* `SERVICE_NAMES`, `INSTANCE_NAME`, `HOST`, `PORT` info needs to be broadcasted.
* Makes instance available in `TNSNAMES.ORA` without manual updates.

üí° If PMON fails to register (e.g., listener not yet up), it will **retry periodically**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Shared Server Architecture Role**

If Oracle is configured for **Shared Server Mode**, PMON also:

* **Restarts** failed dispatcher processes.
* **Monitors** shared server pool health.

---

### üîç **Monitoring PMON**

| View               | Use                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `V$SESSION`        | PMON shows as a background process.                          |
| `V$PROCESS`        | See OS PID tied to PMON.                                     |
| `V$RESOURCE_LIMIT` | Indirectly helps monitor freed session slots.                |
| `ALERT.LOG`        | Logs PMON-related startup/shutdown info and listener issues. |

---

### üí° **Important Notes**

* PMON works closely with SMON:

  * **PMON detects** a dead session.
  * **SMON rolls back** the incomplete transaction (if needed).

* PMON is **not responsible** for rolling back uncommitted work ‚Äî that‚Äôs SMON‚Äôs job.

* Dynamic registration eliminates the need for manual entries in `listener.ora`.

---

### üìå **Real-World Use Case**

> **Scenario**: A developer kills a session during a `DELETE` statement on a large table.

üîÑ Behind the scenes:

* PMON detects session failure.
* Releases locks on that table.
* Cleans up PGA memory and cursors.
* Marks transaction for rollback.
* SMON handles undo if transaction was active.

---

### ‚ùó **Without PMON...**

* Sessions would leave **orphaned locks**, **unreleased memory**, **hanging temp segments**, and more.
* Over time, this would lead to memory pressure, lock contention, and unstable system behavior.
Here‚Äôs a comprehensive, in-depth breakdown of:

## üîπ **5. CKPT (Checkpoint Process)**

üß† **Primary Role**:
CKPT is responsible for **signaling a database checkpoint**, which ensures that all modified (dirty) buffers in the memory are written to disk and that checkpoint metadata is updated in **datafile headers** and **control files**.

---

### üö© **What is a Checkpoint?**

A **checkpoint** is a critical event where Oracle synchronizes the in-memory data (SGA) with the on-disk data (datafiles).
It guarantees **consistency** and helps minimize **recovery time** in case of failure.

---

### ‚úÖ **Functions of CKPT**

| Function                        | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß† **Signals DBWR**             | Tells the **DBWR** process to write dirty buffers from **buffer cache** to **datafiles**.          |
| üìù **Updates Datafile Headers** | Writes the current **System Change Number (SCN)** and checkpoint info into each datafile's header. |
| üìÑ **Updates Control File**     | Writes checkpoint SCN into the control file to maintain database structure and recovery sync.      |
| üìä **Coordinates With LGWR**    | Works alongside LGWR to ensure redo logs and datafiles are in sync.                                |

---

### üîÅ **When Are Checkpoints Triggered?**

| Trigger Type               | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| üïí **Timed Checkpoints**   | Based on `LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT` (e.g., every N seconds). |
| üî¢ **Log Switch-Based**    | After every redo log switch (`LOG_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`).   |
| üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Checkpoint**  | Issued manually with `ALTER SYSTEM CHECKPOINT;`.           |
| üì¶ **Shutdown Checkpoint** | Triggered during `SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE` or `NORMAL`.         |
| üõë **Recovery Checkpoint** | Used during crash recovery or instance recovery.           |

---

### üì¶ **Why Are Checkpoints Important?**

| Benefit                      | Explanation                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Faster Recovery**        | Reduces the number of redo log entries Oracle must apply during recovery. |
| ‚úÖ **Data Consistency**       | Ensures changes in memory are made persistent in the datafiles.           |
| ‚úÖ **Efficient Buffer Cache** | Frees up dirty buffers after flushing them to disk.                       |

---

### üß© **How CKPT Interacts With Other Components**

| Component                | Interaction                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **DBWR**                 | Signals DBWR to write dirty buffers.        |
| **Control File**         | Updates SCN and checkpoint info.            |
| **Datafile Header**      | Writes checkpoint SCN.                      |
| **Redo Logs (via LGWR)** | Coordinates SCN sync between data and redo. |

---

### üîç **Monitoring CKPT**

| View                | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `V$DATAFILE_HEADER` | Check SCN and timestamp of last checkpoint.       |
| `V$DATABASE`        | See checkpoint progress & SCN.                    |
| `V$SYSSTAT`         | Look for checkpoint statistics.                   |
| `ALERT.LOG`         | Logs checkpoint start and completion with reason. |

---

### üß† **CKPT vs DBWR vs LGWR**

| Process  | Responsibility                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CKPT** | Orchestrates the checkpoint and updates metadata (SCN). |
| **DBWR** | Writes actual dirty blocks to disk.                     |
| **LGWR** | Writes redo entries (change records) to redo log files. |

---

### üîß **Checkpoint Tuning Parameters**

| Parameter                 | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET`  | Specifies target mean time to recover (auto-tunes checkpoints). |
| `LOG_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` | Checkpoint every N redo blocks written.                         |
| `LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT`  | Checkpoint every N seconds.                                     |

---

### üìå **Real-World Use Case**

> **Scenario**: You issue `SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE`.

* CKPT is triggered.
* It signals DBWR to flush dirty buffers.
* CKPT updates datafile headers and control files with the SCN.
* Ensures a clean, recoverable state for the next startup.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **If CKPT Fails or Is Delayed...**

* Longer crash recovery times.
* More redo entries to process.
* Higher chance of data inconsistencies in memory vs disk.

Here is a deep-dive explanation of:

---

## üîπ **6. RECO (Recoverer Process)**

üß† **Primary Role**:
The **RECO (Recoverer)** background process **automatically resolves failures in distributed transactions** (two-phase commits). It ensures **atomicity and consistency** across databases in distributed systems.

---

### üåê **What is a Distributed Transaction?**

A **distributed transaction** involves multiple databases (or instances), typically using **database links (DBLINKs)**. Oracle must ensure **all participants either commit or roll back** to preserve data integrity.

Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders@remote_db ...;
```

---

### üîÅ **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol**

RECO works in the **second phase** of this protocol to ensure success or rollback:

| Phase                | Action                                                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1: Prepare** | All databases prepare to commit and respond if they‚Äôre ready.              |
| **Phase 2: Commit**  | Coordinator sends COMMIT if all responded OK. Else, sends ROLLBACK.        |
| **If Crash Happens** | And coordinator fails mid-process, **RECO** resolves when system restarts. |

---

### ‚úÖ **Functions of RECO**

| Function                              | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîÑ **Resolves In-Doubt Transactions** | Automatically connects to other databases and tries to **commit or rollback** distributed transactions that were left in an uncertain (in-doubt) state. |
| üß© **Maintains Consistency**          | Ensures **ACID** compliance across all involved systems.                                                                                                |
| üì° **Periodically Scans**             | Continuously checks the `DBA_2PC_PENDING` table for transactions to recover.                                                                            |
| üõ†Ô∏è **Works With ORA-24756 Errors**   | Detects failed distributed transactions that need action.                                                                                               |

---

### üìù **Common View: `DBA_2PC_PENDING`**

Stores metadata of in-doubt distributed transactions:

```sql
SELECT local_tran_id, global_tran_id, state FROM dba_2pc_pending;
```

| Column           | Meaning                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STATE`          | Can be `collecting`, `prepared`, `committed`, `forced commit`, etc. |
| `LOCAL_TRAN_ID`  | Internal ID for tracking.                                           |
| `GLOBAL_TRAN_ID` | Coordinated across databases.                                       |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **States of In-Doubt Transactions**

| State                         | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `prepared`                    | Transaction is ready but needs decision. |
| `collecting`                  | Waiting for response from other nodes.   |
| `committed` / `forced commit` | Finalized.                               |
| `rollback forced`             | User-forced rollback.                    |

---

### üß† **RECO in Action ‚Äì Real World Example**

**Scenario**:
A transaction spans databases **DB1** and **DB2**.
Just before commit, **DB1 crashes**.
Now DB2 is in a ‚Äúprepared‚Äù state but doesn't know whether to commit or roll back.

‚úÖ When DB1 restarts, RECO:

1. Identifies the in-doubt transaction.
2. Connects to DB2 using the transaction ID.
3. Coordinates the **commit or rollback**.
4. Removes the entry from `DBA_2PC_PENDING`.

---

### üîê **Security Considerations**

* RECO requires **network access** to contact remote DBs.
* Should be monitored in secure environments to avoid unwanted resolution.

---

### üß© **Associated Parameters**

| Parameter                  | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `DISTRIBUTED_TRANSACTIONS` | Max number of distributed transactions. |
| `DISTRIBUTED_LOCK_TIMEOUT` | How long Oracle waits for remote locks. |

---

### üîç **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

| View                   | Use                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `DBA_2PC_PENDING`      | List of unresolved distributed transactions.     |
| `V$GLOBAL_TRANSACTION` | Runtime information on distributed transactions. |
| `ALERT.LOG`            | Logs when RECO takes recovery action.            |

---

### üîß **Manual Intervention (If Needed)**

Use `FORCE COMMIT` or `FORCE ROLLBACK` if RECO can't resolve:

```sql
COMMIT FORCE 'transaction_id';
ROLLBACK FORCE 'transaction_id';
```

---

### üìå **Best Practices**

* Ensure **RECO is running** in any DB using DBLINKs.
* Periodically monitor `DBA_2PC_PENDING`.
* Use **timeout settings** to avoid hanging remote locks.

## ‚úÖ **7. ARCn (Archiver Process)**

üìò **Definition**:
**ARCn (Archiver)** is an Oracle **background process** responsible for **automatically offloading filled online redo log files** to a designated archive location **when the database is in ARCHIVELOG mode**.

üß† Think of ARCn as the **"log offloader"** ‚Äî it **preserves critical redo data** before those redo log files get reused.

---

### üîÑ **Core Functionality**

| Task                                  | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üì§ **Triggers on Log Switch**         | When LGWR fills a redo log and switches to the next one, ARCn picks up the full log.                         |
| üì¶ **Archives to Persistent Storage** | ARCn copies the filled redo log to disk, ASM, FRA, or remote destinations **before the redo log is reused**. |
| üåê **Supports Remote Shipping**       | In a Data Guard setup, ARCn can **send archived logs to a standby database**.                                |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Operational Details**

* **ARCn starts only in ARCHIVELOG mode.**
* Multiple ARCn processes (`ARC0` to `ARCn`) can run in parallel for scalability.
* ARCn **does not write to online redo logs** ‚Äî that‚Äôs LGWR‚Äôs job.
* ARCn simply **copies completed redo log files** to safe, persistent storage.

---

### üß† **ARCn vs LGWR**

| LGWR                                             | ARCn                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Writes **real-time redo** to online redo logs    | Copies **completed** redo logs after a log switch |
| Crucial for **immediate durability** (on COMMIT) | Crucial for **long-term recoverability**          |
| Works continuously                               | Works **on demand** (after log switch)            |

---

### üîê **ARCn‚Äôs Role in Recovery**

Although **archive logs** were discussed earlier as physical files, **ARCn‚Äôs specific responsibility** is to ensure those files are generated **automatically and consistently**.

This enables:

* Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
* RMAN Backups
* Data Guard log shipping
* Flashback and standby sync

---

### üîç **Monitor ARCn Activity**

Use the following views:

```sql
SELECT * FROM V$ARCHIVE_PROCESSES;
SELECT DEST_ID, STATUS, ERROR FROM V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS;
```

---

### üß™ **Common Scenarios**

| Scenario                   | ARCn Behavior                                    |

## **Multitenant Architecture (CDB and PDB)**

*(Introduced in Oracle 12c ‚Äî a major shift in Oracle Database architecture)*

---

### ‚úÖ **What is Multitenant Architecture?**

Multitenant architecture allows **a single Oracle Database container (CDB)** to hold multiple **independent pluggable databases (PDBs)**.

It is Oracle‚Äôs way of:

* Simplifying **database consolidation**
* Improving **manageability**
* Enabling **cloud-ready architecture**

Here is a **clear, detailed explanation of "Server Process vs. User Process"** ‚Äî suitable for teaching and for PowerPoint presentation (dark mode friendly):

---

## **Server Process vs. User Process**

Understanding the difference between **User Process** and **Server Process** is key to grasping how Oracle handles requests internally.

---

### ‚úÖ **What is a User Process?**

**User Process** is the program that runs on the **client machine** (or user terminal).

It is responsible for:

* Initiating a connection to the Oracle Database
* Sending SQL queries to the database
* Receiving query results from the database

üß† Think of it as **‚Äúthe user‚Äôs program interacting with Oracle‚Äù**

#### üî∏ Examples:

* SQL\*Plus, SQL Developer, Toad, JDBC/ODBC Applications

---

### ‚úÖ **What is a Server Process?**

**Server Process** is a process **spawned by the Oracle Database** to service a specific user session.

It is responsible for:

* Receiving SQL statements from the user process
* Executing SQL on behalf of the user
* Fetching data from disk (via DBWn, SGA)
* Returning results to the user

üß† Think of it as **‚Äúthe database‚Äôs representative working for a user session‚Äù**

---

### ‚úÖ **How They Work Together**

```
User Machine                           Oracle Server
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ                       ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

### ‚úÖ **Server Process Types**

| Mode                 | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dedicated Server** | One server process per user session (common in OLTP).                                       |
| **Shared Server**    | A pool of server processes shared among multiple sessions (used in high-user environments). |

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Differences**

| Feature        | User Process                         | Server Process                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Location       | Client machine                       | Oracle database server                   |
| Created By     | Client application (SQL\*Plus, etc.) | Oracle Listener                          |
| Role           | Initiates requests                   | Executes requests                        |
| Communication  | Sends SQL, receives results          | Receives SQL, processes, returns results |
| Resource Usage | Uses client resources                | Uses server memory, CPU, I/O             |

| 3    | **Optimizer** builds execution plan using indexes, stats              |
| 4    | **Execution begins**: Server process looks for blocks in buffer cache |
| 5    | If not found, **blocks are fetched** from disk (datafiles)            |
| 6    | Blocks are placed in buffer cache and data is read from there         |
| 7    | **Data rows** are returned back to the client                         |
